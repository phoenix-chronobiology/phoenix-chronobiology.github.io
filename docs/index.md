## The Phoenix Vision

**{{ config.site_name }}** envision:

1. Using [chronobiologic](glossary/index.md#chronobiology) principles (timing according to rhythms) for assessing cardiovascular health, detecting [pre-disease](glossary/index.md#predisease) early, and optimizing treatment schedules, in order to reduce the number of people who die of preventable heart attacks and strokes.
2. Understanding, for health surveillance and maintenance, how blood pressure and heart rate vary in response to stimuli in everyday life.

## The Phoenix Community

**{{ config.site_name }}**:

1. Collaborate with the University of Minnesota's [Halberg Chronobiology Center](https://halbergchronobiologycenter.umn.edu){: target="_blank" }.
1. Operate as a study group of the [Twin Cities Section of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE](https://tc-ieee.org){: target="_blank" }.

Though the project's core engineers are members of the Twin Cities Section, the projects welcome students, engineers and scientists regardless of IEEE membership.

The Projects operate on [open source principles](https://opensource.org/osd/){: target="_blank" }, so they can learn from others and others can learn from the Projects.

## The Phoenix Mission

**{{ config.site_name }}** will: 

1.  Develop an ambulatory blood pressure monitor

    * Inexpensive
    * Unobtrusive
    * Easy to use
    * Collects a week of blood pressure measurements

    See the [Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor project](abpm/index.md).

2. **Develop a means for chronobiological analysis of collected blood pressure measurements**&emsp;

    See the:
    
    * [Biorhythm Analysis Algorithms project](algorithms/index.md)
    * [Biorhythm Analytics Platform project](biorhythm-platform/index.md)

3. Be a learning community

4. Deliver the monitor and analytic framework to the [Halberg Chronobiology Center](https://halbergchronobiologycenter.umn.edu){: target="_blank" }, for long term use on massive scale to:

    * Obtain measures of health
    * Encourage the development of techniques for diagnosis, prevention and treatment
