    The ***Blog*** is an online journal of activities within [The&nbsp;Phoenix&nbsp;Chronobiology&nbsp;Projects](../index.md). The content initially comprises minutes of project meetings, and could later include announcements of events that have occurred or are planned to shortly occur.

    For a design direction, see [About &rarr; Blog](../about/index.md#blog).

    The posts listed here are placeholders, to illustrate the blog feature and to guide new authors.
