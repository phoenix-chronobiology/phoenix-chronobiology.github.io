<span id="acrophase">acrophase</span>
: [statistics]
:   1. Measure of timing of a rhythm in relation to a defined reference time point selected by the investigator (e. g., local midnight for circadian rhythms); used for data which can be described by the fitting of a mathematical model, e.g., a cosine curve, and represents the crest time of the cosine curve best fitting to the data; may be expressed in (negative) degrees as the lag from the acrophase reference (360&deg;C =1 period) or in calendar time units (e.g., hours and minutes for circadian rhythms, days or months for infradian rhythms). (source: [AAMCC](http://www.aamcc.net/glossary.htm){: target="_blank" })
    2. _n_. The time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs. Note: Originally, acrophase referred to the phase angle of the peak of a cosine wave fitted to the raw data of a rhythm (time series). When the term is applied to the actual rhythm, the acrophase will likely vary from cycle to cycle. Unit of measurement: hours (h) or degrees of circumference (&deg;) in relation to an absolute or arbitrary reference. Caveat: The official units of time and of plane angle in the International System of Units are, respectively, the second and the radian. // Cf. [cosinor](#cosinor) and [peak](#peak). (source: [circadian.org](http://www.circadian.org/dictionary.html){: target="_blank" })
    3. The lag between the reference time (midnight, or 0000 hours in a 24-hour day) and the time of the rhythm's crest.

: 1. The value midway between the highest and the lowest values of the (cosine) function that best fits the data.

        The "M" is equal to the arithmetic mean only for equidistant data covering an integral number of cycles.  If, for example, most of the data are clustered around the peak of the curve, because the researcher gathered more data at this time, the arithmetic mean will be much higher than the MESOR.

    2. _n_. An estimate of central tendency of the distribution of values of an oscillating variable (the average value around which the variable oscillates).

        The MESOR is a circadian rhythm-adjusted mean based on the parameters of a cosine function fitted to the raw data. Note: When a process is known to be rhythmic, and the data points are not equidistant or the sample size is small, the MESOR often provides a more appropriate unbiased estimator of central tendency than does the arithmetic mean of the raw data. // Cf.

One way to look at this is to say that on the basis of the data, the circadian variation is assessed by fitting a model to the data, and this model is characterized by three parameters:  the MESOR, the 24-hour amplitude, the 24-hour acrophase.
(If considered, a two-component model is charactered by five parameters, the three components of the one-component model plus the 12-hour amplitude and the 12-hour acrophase).

: a 24-hour blood pressure record based on a computer comparison of a given subject's data with time-specified reference limits of clinically healthy peers of the same gender and age.   Sphygmochrons provide, by complementary (parametric and nonparametric) approaches, an inferential statistical basis for the diagnosis of blood pressure disorders

<span id="sphygmomanometer">sphygmomanometer</span>
: An inflatable cuff used to measure blood pressure.
: Operation:  The cuff is placed around the upper arm, at roughly the same vertical height as the heart while the subject is in a sitting position.  The cuff is inflated until the artery is completely occluded.  Listening with a stethoscope to the brachial artery at the elbow, the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff.  As the pressure in the cuffs falls, a "whooshing" or pounding sound is heard (see Korotkoff sounds) when blood-flow first starts again in the artery. The pressure at which this sound began is noted and recorded as the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is further released until the sound can _n_. longer be heard and this is recorded as the diastolic blood pressure.

A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean, whereas high standard deviation indicates that the data are spread out over a large range of values.

        Common examples of measures of statistical dispersion are the variance, standard deviation and interquartile range.

        Dispersion is contrasted with location or central tendency, and together they are the most used properties of distributions.

### Z

<span id="zeitgeber">Zeitgeber</span>
: An environmental agent or event that provides the cue for setting or resetting a biological clock.
: To be synchronized with our environment, we need the input of Zeitgebers. The most important Zeitgeber in nature is light. Social factors, chemical factors and activity can also serve as Zeitgebers. Light is a so-called photic type Zeitgeber, whereas activity, for example, is called a non-photic Zeitgeber for the biological clock.
: Zeitgeber comes from the German <dfn>Zeit</dfn>, time + <dfn>Geber</dfn>, giver = time-giver. The term <dfn>Zeitgeber</dfn> was introduced into science about 1954 by Jurgen Aschoff, then the Director of the Max-Planck-Institute in Erling-Andechs, near Munich.
