<span id="dg_correctness">Correctness</span>
: This design correctly matches the given requirements.

<span id="dg_feasibility">Feasibility</span>
: This design can be implemented and tested with the planned amount of time and effort.

<span id="dg_understandability">Understandability</span>
: Developers can understand this design and correctly implement it.

<span id="dg_guidance">Implementation phase guidance</span>
: This design divides the implementation into components or aspects that can correspond to reasonable implementation tasks.

<span id="dg_modularity">Modularity</span>
: Concerns are clearly separated so that the impact of most design changes would be limited to only one or a few modules.

<span id="dg_extensibility">Extensibility</span>
: New [features](#feature) or components can be easily added later.

<span id="dg_testability">Testability</span>
: It is easy to test components of this design independently, and information is available to help diagnose defects.

<span id="dg_efficency">Efficiency</span>
: The design enables the system to perform functions with an acceptable amount of time, storage space, bandwidth, and other resources.

<span id="dg_easy_integration">Ease of integration</span>
: The components will work together.

<span id="dg_cap_match">Capacity matching</span>
: The architecture deploys components onto machines that provide needed resources with reasonable total expense.

<span id="dg_expressiveness">Expressiveness</span>
: It allows for storage of all valid values and relationships

<span id="dg_easy_access">Ease of access</span>
: Application code to access stored data is simple

<span id="dg_data_reliability">Reliability</span>
: Stored data cannot easily be corrupted by defective code, concurrent access, or unexpected process termination

<span id="dg_data_capacity">Data capacity</span>
: The system can store the amount of data needed.

<span id="dg_data_security">Data security</span>
: Protection of sensitive user and corporate data from unauthorized access or modification

<span id="dg_data_performance">Performance</span>
: Data can be accessed quickly

<span id="dg_data_interop">Interoperability</span>
: The database or data files can be accessed and updated by other applications

<span id="dg_no_intrusion">Intrusion prevention</span>
: Prevent, e.g., hackers opening a command shell on our server.

<span id="dg_no_abuse">Abuse prevention</span>
: Prevention of abuse (e.g., using our system to send spam).

<span id="dg_auditability">Auditability</span>
: All changes can be accounted for later.

<span id="dg_use_understand">Understandability and learnability</span>
: Users can reasonably be expected to understand the UI at first sight. Users will be able to discover additional [features](#feature)without aid from other users or documentation, and they will be able to recall what they have learned.

<span id="dg_use_efficiency">Task support and efficiency</span>
: The UI is well matched to the users' tasks and it can be used with a reasonable number of clicks and keystrokes.

<span id="dg_use_safety">Safety</span>
: Users are not likely to accidentally produce an undesired result (e.g., delete data, or send a half-finished email).

<span id="dg_use_consistency">Consistency and familiarity</span>
: Users can apply their knowledge of similar UIs or UI standards to this system.
