!!! abstract "The Idea"
    The ***Library*** is an indexed collection of papers and slides about topics that are important to [The&nbsp;Phoenix&nbsp;Chronobiology&nbsp;Projects](..). These include:
    
    * Publications and research materials written by members of the project.
    * Reference materials used by the project.

    Each item in the library has a "library index card" that attributes the asset with:
    
    1. Its title.
    1. The authors.
    1. An abstract.
    1. The Date of distribution or publication.
    1. A citation to the work.
    1. URLs to the digital files comprising the asset. The work may consist of some combination of papers, slides, spreadsheets, or graphics.

    The ***Library*** is modeled after [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), a GitHub Pages template for personal and professional portfolio-oriented websites.

    The URLs will usually point into the GitHub repository that is the source for the the Library. However, a card might contain a link into a GitHub repository of an individual project contributor, or into the home site of the project sponsor, the University of Minnesota's [Halberg Chronobiology Center](https://halbergchronobiologycenter.umn.edu){: target="_blank" }.
