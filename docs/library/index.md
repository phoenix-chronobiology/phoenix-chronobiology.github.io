    The ***Library*** is an indexed collection of papers and slides about topics that are important to [The&nbsp;Phoenix&nbsp;Chronobiology&nbsp;Projects](..). These include:
    
    * Publications and research materials written by members of the project.
    * Reference materials used by the project.

    The ***Library*** is modeled after [Academic Pages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), a GitHub Pages template for personal and professional portfolio-oriented websites.

    For a design direction, see [About &rarr; Library](../about/index.md#library).
