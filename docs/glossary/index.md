: [hypertension](#hypertension) as indicated by measurements taken during multiple days
: For systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, a transient or lasting elevation of the [circadian](#circadian) rhythm-adjusted mean ([MESOR](#mesor)) as validated statistically against the person's (patient's) own MESOR at another time and/or against a peer reference standard.
: Though the condition is sometimes categorized as a [vascular variability disorder](#vascular-variability-disorder), the MESOR is a type of average and not a measure of variability per se. One way to look at this is to say that on the basis of the data, the circadian variation is assessed by fitting a model to the data, and this model is characterized by three parameters:  the [MESOR](#mesor), the 24-hour [amplitude](#amplitude), the 24-hour [acrophase](#acrophase). (If considered, a two-component model is characterized by five parameters, the three components of the one-component model plus the 12-hour amplitude and the 12-hour acrophase).

: An inflatable cuff used to measure blood pressure.
: Operation:  The cuff is placed around the upper arm, at roughly the same vertical height as the heart while the subject is in a sitting position.  The cuff is inflated until the artery is completely occluded.  Listening with a stethoscope to the brachial artery at the elbow, the examiner slowly releases the pressure in the cuff.  As the pressure in the cuffs falls, a "whooshing" or pounding sound is heard (see Korotkoff sounds) when blood-flow first starts again in the artery. The pressure at which this sound began is noted and recorded as the systolic blood pressure. The cuff pressure is further released until the sound can _n_. longer be heard and this is recorded as the diastolic blood pressure.

        Dispersion is contrasted with location or central tendency, and together they are the most used properties of distributions.

<span id="zeitgeber">Zeitgeber</span>
: An environmental agent or event that provides the cue for setting or resetting a biological clock.

Social factors, chemical factors and activity can also serve as Zeitgebers. Light is a so-called photic type Zeitgeber, whereas activity, for example, is called a non-photic Zeitgeber for the biological clock.
: Zeitgeber comes from the German <dfn>Zeit</dfn>, time + <dfn>Geber</dfn>, giver = time-giver. The term <dfn>Zeitgeber</dfn> was introduced into science about 1954 by Jurgen Aschoff, then the Director of the Max-Planck-Institute in Erling-Andechs, near Munich.
